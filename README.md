# db_designer_core

Implementation of db_designer web component.

To run (to see an example):
  1. npm i
  2. npm start
  3. In chrome browser navigate to http://localhost:9998/example (If it did not load properly refresh. I am looking into resolving that bug)

This project only works on chrome browser right now.
